# Security-in-software-design-and-dev
A software project plan, under the secure development life cycle (SDLC)

This project is designed to guide the developer through software security design under the secure development life cycle. It is a hands-on research and development exercise focused on security-oriented design and development. The process will follow through several stages of security-oriented development, scoped with primary reference to the microsoft security engineering practices and the secure development life cycle as follows:
1. Project Description and Documentation Plan 
2. Application Requirements
3. Design 
4. Threat Modelling and Tracking
5. Development Plan
6. Implementation
7. Testing
8. Periodic Verification Review
9. Security Evaluation
10. Release Planning and Documentation
11. Software Release

Each step of the project cycle has two key components:
- **The Development**: writing the software
- **The Documentation**: writing notes on the development considerations, tools and processes, and creating a wiki 

If you get through the steps below, you will have an application, its documentation and a wiki.
